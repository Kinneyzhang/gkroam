** Introduction
   Gkroam is a lightweight [[https://roamresearch.com][Roam Research]] replica, built on top of emacs org-mode. It uses 'ripgrep' to search pages' links and insert references at the bottom of org pages automatically. Almostly, gkroam imitates roam research in as many aspects as possible.

** Demos

** Installation
   
   Clone this repo and add gkroam to your emacs load-path. My configurations are as follows. Feel free to modify them as you like.

   Now, you can also install gkroam from Melpa with =package-install=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package gkroam
     :ensure t
     :init
     (setq gkroam-root-dir "~/gkroam/org/"
           gkroam-pub-dir "~/gkroam/site/")
     :bind
     (("C-c r G" . gkroam-update-all)
      ("C-c r g" . gkroam-update)
      ("C-c r d" . gkroam-daily)
      ("C-c r f" . gkroam-find)
      ("C-c r c" . gkroam-capture)
      ("C-c r e" . gkroam-link-edit)
      ("C-c r n" . gkroam-smart-new)
      ("C-c r i" . gkroam-insert)
      ("C-c r I" . gkroam-index)
      ("C-c r p" . gkroam-preview)
      ("C-c r v" . gkroam-preview-current)
      ("C-c r t" . gkroam-toggle-brackets))
     :config
     ;; when this minor mode is on, show and hide brackets dynamically.
     (gkroam-dynamic-brackets-mode -1))
   #+END_SRC

** Dependency

   * [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][simple-httpd]] is used to preview html.
   * [[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-db][db]] is used to cache page and headline id.
   * [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company]] is used to complete double brackets link and hashtags.
   * [[https://github.com/tarsiiformes/undo-tree][undo-tree]] is used to restore gkroam formatted link after publishing.
   * *ripgrep(rg)* is used to search reference link.

** Tips (important!)

   - Install ripgrep(rg) command line firstly and make sure it is in exec-path list.
   - Do not set =company-idle-delay= variable to zero, it will causes an error. see [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/455][issue#455]].
   - Use =gkroam-build-caches= to generate all healines' id and cache them in db manually.
   - If message "None existence agenda file ..." when first open a gkroam page, set =org-agenda-files= to a directory may take care of it.

** Usage
*** Link form

    - page link: ={[<title>]}=
    - headline link: ={[<title> » <headline>]}=
    - page link with aliase: ={[<title>][aliase]}=
    - headline link with aliase: ={[<title> » <headline>][aliase]}=

*** Main functions

    =gkroam-find=\\
    Find a gkroam file and open it. If not exisit, create a new one. Just like /ido-find-file/.

    =gkroam-capture=\\
    Capture many pages in a side window and save changes by pressing =C-c C-c=, abort changes by pressing =C-c C-k=.

    =gkroam-link-edit=\\
    Edit link in minibuffer. This function is very useful when brackets are hidden.

    =gkroam-daily=\\
    Create or open 'daily notes' page.

    =gkroam-toggle-brackets=\\
    Hide and show brackets of link and hashtag.

    =gkroam-insert=\\
    Insert a page bracket link at point.

    =gkroam-smart-new=\\
    Smartly create a new file. If in a region, read the text in region as file title. if a word at point, read the text at point as file title. Otherwise, use =gkroam-find=. At last, insert a file link at point or in region.

    =gkroam-index=\\
    Show gkroam index page. Well, it's just a simple site map because I have not get good ideas about it. Feel free to give me an issue or PR.

    =gkroam-update=\\
    Update current buffer's references. Actually, references are updated automatically.

    =gkroam-update-all=\\
    Update all files' references.

    /It's not a good idea to publish roam pages to html beacause when there are a huge of pages, the publishing process will be much slow. So I will consider remove the following commands./

    =gkroam-publish-current-file=\\
    Publish current file to html.

    =gkroam-preview-current=\\
    Preview current file in browser.

    =gkroam-publish-site=\\
    Publish the whole gkroam site.

    =gkroam-preview=\\
    Preview gkroam site's index page.

** ChangeLog
   - =v1.0=: Auto update link references at the bottom of page buffer.
   - =v2.0=: Use overlay to hide and show gkroam brackets accordingly and fix some bugs.
   - =v2.0.1=: Fix 'hide and show brackets' problems in some main occasion. Such as newline, etc.
   - =v2.0.2=: Fix =gkroam-publish-current-file=, automatically convert gkroam link to org link and convert it back after published (use 'undo', not reliable) . But it has problem with publishing the whole project.
   - =v2.0.3=: Fix =gkroam-publish-site= and =gkroam-preview=. Now you can publish and preview the whole roam site.
   - =v2.0.4=: Many bugs fixed and code improvement.
   - =v2.1.0=: A more powerful linked references system.
   - =v2.1.1=: Change package name to 'gkroam'.
   - =v2.2.0=: Implement =gkroam-edit= .
   - =v2.3.0=: Implement headline references, add a new minor mode =gkroam-dynamic-brackets-mode= and rename =gkroam-edit= to =gkroam-capture=.
   - =2.3.1=: A more resonable way to insert link. Press "C-p RET" or "C-M-j" directly to skip headline completion for ivy user or just press "RET" for vanilla user.

** TodoList
   
   Recently, I have been watching [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwXSqDdn_CpE934BjXMgmzHnlwXMy41TC][videos]] about Roam Research. From it, I have got lots of ideas to improve gkroam. The ideas are as follows:

   * [X] Simply insert linked references at the bottom of page.
   * [X] Add "gkroam-daily" function to open a 'daily notes' page.
   * [X] Custom link notation: "{[page-title]}" for page link, "#{[page-title]}" for hashtag.
   * [X] Do auto completion after input brackets and hash symbol.
   * [X] Automatically hide and show brackets when move to a line including gkroam links.
   * [X] Convert gkroam link to org file link before publish and convert back when published.
   * [X] A more reasonable linked references form.
   * [X] Implement roam research like sidebar, named 'gkroam-edit' function.
   * [X] Implement org headline references, add a new minor mode =gkroam-dynamic-brackets-mode=.
   * [ ] Beautify gkroam page: set window margin, unify bullet style and so on.
   * [ ] Implement 'block references' and 'block embeds'.

   More in future!
