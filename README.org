** Introduction
   Gkroam is a lightweight [[https://roamresearch.com][Roam Research]] replica, built on top of emacs org-mode. It uses 'ripgrep' to search links on pages and insert references at the bottom of org pages automatically. The principle of Gkroam is "Be faithful to Roam Research".

   =v2.4.1 gkroam-index buffer:=
   
   [[./image/gkroam-index.png]]

** Installation
   
   Clone this repo and add gkroam to your emacs load-path. My configurations are as follows. Feel free to modify them as to however you prefer.

   Now, you can also install gkroam from Melpa with =package-install=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package gkroam
     :ensure t
     :hook (after-init . gkroam-mode)
     :init
     (setq gkroam-root-dir "~/gkroam/org/")
     (setq gkroam-prettify-page-p t
           gkroam-show-brackets-p t
           gkroam-use-default-filename t
           gkroam-window-margin 4)
     :bind
     (:map gkroam-mode-map
           (("C-c r I" . gkroam-index)
            ("C-c r d" . gkroam-daily)
            ("C-c r D" . gkroam-delete)
            ("C-c r f" . gkroam-find)
            ("C-c r i" . gkroam-insert)
            ("C-c r n" . gkroam-dwim)
            ("C-c r c" . gkroam-capture)
            ("C-c r e" . gkroam-link-edit)
            ("C-c r p" . gkroam-toggle-prettify)
            ("C-c r t" . gkroam-toggle-brackets)
            ("C-c r R" . gkroam-rebuild-caches)
            ("C-c r g" . gkroam-update))))

** Dependencies

   * [[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-db][db]] is used to cache page and headline ids.
   * [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company]] is used to auto-complete double bracket links and hashtags.
   * [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep(rg)]] is used to search reference links.

** Tips (important)

   - Install the command line search tool *ripgrep(rg)* first and make sure it is in the exec-path list.
   - Page's headline should not match the regexp "^* [0-9]+ Linked References.*" because it's the delimiter for page contents and reference region.
   - Use =gkroam-rebuild-caches= to generate all caches. If you got an error when click a headline link, this command is also very useful.

** Usage
*** Link format

    - page link: ={[<title>]}=
    - page link with alias: ={[<title>][<alias>]}=

    - headline link: ={[<title> » <headline>]}=
    - headline link with alias: ={[<title> » <headline>][<alias>]}=

*** Main functions

    =gkroam-find=\\
    Find a gkroam file and open it. If it does not exist, create a new one. Just like /ido-find-file/.

    =gkroam-insert=\\
    Insert a page bracket link at point.

    =gkroam-delete=\\
    Delete one or more gkroam pages.

    =gkroam-daily=\\
    Create or open 'daily notes' page.

    =gkroam-dwim=\\
    Smartly create a new file. If in a region, read the text in region as file title. If a word at point, read the text at point as file title. Otherwise, use =gkroam-find=. Finally, insert a file link at point or in region.

    =gkroam-index=\\
    Show gkroam index buffer. Index buffer includes all gkroam pages' title, word counts, mentions, updated time and created time. You can click mentions number to see all references in a side window.

    =gkroam-capture=\\
    Capture many pages in a side window and save changes by pressing =C-c C-c=, abort changes by pressing =C-c C-k=.

    =gkroam-link-edit=\\
    Edit link in minibuffer. This function is very useful when brackets are hidden.

    =gkroam-toggle-brackets=\\
    Hide and show brackets of link and hashtag.

    =gkroam-toggle-prettify=\\
    Whether to prettify gkroam page.

    =gkroam-update=\\
    Update current buffer's references. Actually, references are updated automatically.

    =gkroam-rebuild-caches=\\
    Rebuild all caches, including page and filename cache, headline and headline id cache, page and references cache. It may takes seconds to build all, please be patient.


** ChangeLog
   - =v1.0=: Auto update link references at the bottom of page buffer.
   - =v2.0=: Use overlay to hide and show gkroam brackets accordingly and fix some bugs.
   - =v2.0.1=: Fix 'hide and show brackets' problems in some main occasion. Such as newline, etc.
   - =v2.0.2=: Fix =gkroam-publish-current-file=, automatically convert gkroam link to org link and convert it back after published (use 'undo', not reliable) . But it has problem with publishing the whole project.
   - =v2.0.3=: Fix =gkroam-publish-site= and =gkroam-preview=. Now you can publish and preview the whole roam site.
   - =v2.0.4=: Many bugs fixed and code improvement.
   - =v2.1.0=: A more powerful linked references system.
   - =v2.1.1=: Change package name to 'gkroam'.
   - =v2.2.0=: Implement =gkroam-edit= .
   - =v2.3.0=: Implement headline references, add a new minor mode =gkroam-dynamic-mode= and rename =gkroam-edit= to =gkroam-capture=.
   - =v2.3.1=: A more reasonable way to insert links. Press "C-p RET" or "C-M-j" directly to skip headline completion for ivy user or just press "RET" for vanilla user.
   - =v2.3.2=: Beautify page: unify org list bullet and beautify org checkbox. Better to turn it off when editing the page. Function `gkroam-toggle-beautify'.
   - =v2.3.3=: Make page filename customizable, delete index file and show index in buffer.
   - =v2.3.4=: Delete 'gkroam-dynamic-brackets-mode' and add =gkroam-toggle-dynamic= function.
   - =v2.3.5=: Optimize gkroam page prettification, change 'gkroam-toggle-beautify' to `gkroam-toggle-prettify'.

   - =v2.3.6=: Implement a perfect linked references workflow. When a link is the item of org plain list, the whole list structure will be shown. The same as any source block, verse block, etc.

   - =v2.3.7=: Add headline id only when you insert a gkroam link. Use `gkroam-rebuild-caches' command to rebuild headline and id caches.

   - =v2.4.0=
     - Delete =gkroam-toggle-dynamic= command
     - Set gkroam-mode as a minor mode, instead of a major mode derived from org-mode
     - Use text properties to render gkroam links.
     - More caches and a big improvement in performance.
       - Cache gkroam pages and their filenames.
       - Cache gkroam pages and their references. Upadte references only when there're changes in references.
     - Prettify and enhance linked references
       - Change backlink format to "{{page::line-number}{alias}}"
       - Show list item's parent items above it and shadow them.
       - Highlight each reference region.
       - Jump back to the specific line when click backlink.

   - =v2.4.1=
     - Implement a Roam Research like index buffer.
     - Add new command =gkroam-delete=.
     - Rename 'gkroam-smart-new' to =gkroam-dwim=.

** TodoList
   
   Recently, I have been watching [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwXSqDdn_CpE934BjXMgmzHnlwXMy41TC][videos]] about Roam Research. From these, I have gotten lots of ideas on how to improve gkroam. The ideas are as follows:

   * [X] Simply insert linked references at the bottom of page.
   * [X] Add "gkroam-daily" function to open a 'daily notes' page.
   * [X] Custom link notation: "{[page-title]}" for page link, "#{[page-title]}" for hashtag.
   * [X] Do auto completion after input brackets and hash symbol.
   * [X] Automatically hide and show brackets when move to a line including gkroam links.
   * [X] Convert gkroam link to org file link before publish and convert back when published.
   * [X] A more reasonable linked references form.
   * [X] Implement roam research like sidebar, named 'gkroam-edit' function.
   * [X] Implement org headline references, add a new minor mode =gkroam-dynamic-mode=.
   * [X] Beautify gkroam page: set window margin, unify bullet style and so on.
   * [X] Make page filename customizable.
   * [X] Generate headline id only when you insert a gkroam link.
   * [ ] Implement 'unlinked references'.
   * [ ] Implement 'linked references' filter function.
   * [ ] Implement 'block reference' and 'block embed'.

   More in future!
